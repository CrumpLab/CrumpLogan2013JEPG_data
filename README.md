### 800typists.txt
Contains keystroke timing data for 800 typists who each copy typed a single paragraph of approximately 120 words. The .txt file has four columns:
  a. subject - subject number
  b. paragraph_label - indicates which paragraph (1 to 4) they typed
  c. typed_paragraph - the letters that were typed
  d. time_stamps - UNIX timestamps in milliseconds for each keystroke
The 800typists_readme.txt contains the four original paragraphs, which can be used to code for errors.
