The four original paragraphs are given below. Each subject copied one of these paragraphs.

Par 1

The natural working ability in Border Collies makes them most easy to train, yet there are some dogs that have no working instinct whatever, and will never become effective sheep workers however long they are trained.  It is not unusual for farmers to buy a fully or partly trained dog, as some have neither the time nor the ability to train the dogs themselves.  It also means that they do not waste valuable time on a dog that may not turn out to be a successful worker.  Many farmers find that the cost of such a dog is well worth it.  Even good trial dogs sometimes change ownership, but the prices are very high.

Par 2

Dogs have been part of human life since before history was recorded.  People started to make use of dogs very early in their relationship.  First, they were used as guards for the home, and later as guards for other properties, such as livestock.  In early times, they were guards only, and there is no written record of dogs working with livestock in any way until the Book of Job in the Old Testament.  Even here they are referred to only briefly, and it would seem that they were guard dogs only, even then.  The first modern reference to a dog working sheep in a similar manner to the modern Border Collie was made in the seventeenth century.

Par 3:

Border Collies have become the chief participant in the sport of agility.  Their natural athleticism and keenness to please have made them a very suitable subject for this sport, where the main requirements are speed and the ability to clear a variety of jumps, weave through poles, and go through tunnels.  If the Border Collie has a fault in this sport, it is that it can be faster than the handler, and this can lead to errors.  It is no coincidence, though, that the top agility dog has been a Border Collie since they started recording winners.  Working trials are yet another canine sphere where Border Collies have become the dog to beat.

Par 4

A Border Collie is never happier than when doing something.  Such is their desire to please that they are willing to be trained to do most things, and they usually excel in the field chosen for them by their owner.  Although primarily a sheep dog, the Border Collie is not averse to turning his paw to anything that involves work or pleasure in any sphere.  Border Collies are the dogs to beat at obedience trials.  They relish working hard with their handlers, and seem to find little difficulty in adapting their sheep-working habits to obedience, which, on the face of it, appears to be a totally different set of skills.
